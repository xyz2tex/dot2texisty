This package allows you to include graphs in the DOT graph description language
in your LaTeX documents. The dot2tex[1] tool is used to invoke Graphviz[2] for
graph layout, and to transform the output from Graphviz to LaTeX code.
The generated code relies on the TikZ and PGF package or the PSTricks package.
